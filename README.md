Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength.

## Objective: Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.
## Tools: Online free password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com).
## Deliverables: Report showing password strength results and explanation.
## Key Concepts: Password strength, brute force attack, dictionary attack, authentication,best practices.

**Sample Passwords Created**
- Very Weak : password123
- Medium : Name@#2025
- Strong : Run_Fast!2025
- Very Strong : M00!M@ked#2025

**Password Strength Results (tested on https://www.passwordmonster.com / similar tool)**
- password123 → Very Weak  → Easily cracked by dictionary & brute-force attacks.
- Name@#2025 → Medium → Better but predictable.
- Run_Fast!2025 → Strong→ Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special symbols, and good length.
- M00!M@ked#2025 → Very Strong → Long passphrase, hard to brute force.

**Best Practices Learned**
- Use at least 12–16 characters.
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Avoid dictionary words & personal info.
- Use passphrases (easy to remember, hard to guess).
- Change passwords regularly.
- Use password managers to store unique passwords.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra security.

**Common Password Attacks**
- Brute Force Attack: attacker tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found.
- Dictionary Attack: attacker uses a list of common words and passwords.
- Phishing: tricking user into revealing their password.
- Credential Stuffing: reusing leaked passwords on different sites.

**How Complexity Affects Security**
- Short/simple passwords → cracked in seconds.
- Complex & long passwords → exponentially increase cracking time (sometimes billions of years for brute-force).
- Passphrases → balance between memorability and security.

**Screenshots Added**

2. Medium Password
3. Strong Password
4. Very Strong Password

**A strong password combines length + complexity + unpredictability. The most secure option is a unique passphrase + MFA.**

## Outcome: Understanding password security and best practices.
